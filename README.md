# Running
To run the backend, navigate to /backend, then run `npm install`, followed by `npm run start`. The backend uses port 3000, which is currently hardcoded.

To run the frontend server, navigate to /frontend, then run `npm install`, followed by `npm run start`. The frontend server uses port 4000, which is currently hardcoded.

The frontend also comes with the `lint`, `test:unit`, and `start` scripts, which are for linting, running jest tests, and running the development server respectively.

The fake landing page can be accessed by navigating to <http://localhost:4000>, from which the page with the specified features can be accessed by navigating to the drivers page from the header.

Usually, in a setup like this, I'd put these two in different repos, but I decided to consolidate them into one here for your convenience.
